# QuickStockInfo
A stock dashboard made using the Streamlit API. The purpose is to get as much information in as little space as possible. The information might include price data (info + plot), avg returns and covariance between stocks, the Efficient Frontier with randomly generated portfolios based on given input, as well as Google Gemini analysis (info breakdown).

This is an open project. If you would like to participate, please message or email me.
